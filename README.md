# fedora-nobara-additionscript
My script to run after installing Fedora-Nobara from GloriousEggroll, without changing any of the work he's done. Just adding my own stuff.

## Quick Start
```
git clone https://github.com/al12gamer/fedora-nobara-additionscript.git
cd fedora-nobara-additionscript
sudo bash nobara-ps.sh
```
